# Coffee Machine OOP

This program simulates a coffee vending machine using object-oriented programming. It performs the following functions:

* Prompt User: Continuously prompts users to select an action until turned off. The prompt reappears after each action.

* Turn Off Machine: Maintainers can enter "off" to turn off the machine.

* Generate Report: Entering "report" displays the current resource levels (e.g., water, milk, coffee, and money).

* Check Resources: Ensures sufficient resources are available to make the selected drink. Displays a warning if resources are insufficient.

* Process Coins: Accepts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), calculates their total value, and checks if enough money was inserted.

* Handle Transactions: Refunds money if insufficient funds are provided. Calculates and returns change if overpaid. Adds drink cost to the machine's profit.

* Make Coffee: Deducts the required resources, prepares the drink, and displays a message like “Here is your latte Enjoy!”.
